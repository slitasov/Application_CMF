# Application_CMF

This repository contains my answers to the two challenges given during the CMF program application process.

The challenges include:

Crafting a Stoikov market-making algorithm and conducting a backtest using actual data. An additional feature addressing volatility imbalance is also integrated.
Valuing options using the Black Scholes formula, the Binomial tree method, and the Monte Carlo simulation.
