# Application_CMF

This repository contains my solutions to the two tasks given during the CMF program application process.

The challenges include:

1. **venv folder**. Crafting a Stoikov market-making algorithm and conducting a backtest using actual data. An additional feature addressing volatility imbalance is also integrated.
2. **task2 folder**. Valuing options using the Black Scholes formula, the Binomial tree method, and the Monte Carlo simulation.
